# ArcFace Facial Recognition Model Training

This notebook demonstrates how to train a facial recognition model using the ArcFace loss. ArcFace provides discriminative feature learning by enforcing an angular margin between classes, ideal for face recognition tasks.

### Steps Covered
- Data Loading (expects YOLO-style format or provide new loader)
- Model Construction (ResNet backbone + ArcFace Head, or use a prebuilt library)
- Training Loop (PyTorch; with ArcFace loss)
- Evaluation

---

## Requirements
- `torch`, `torchvision`
- `opencv-python`
- `matplotlib`
- `numpy`
- Optionally: `facenet-pytorch`, `arcface-pytorch` for ready-to-use ArcFace head/model

## Data Format
Update path to dataset root as needed. Use existing `dataset` structure or adapt loader for your image/label format.

## Example: Model Setup
```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
from torchvision import models
# Insert ArcFace head import or implementation below.
```

## Training & Evaluation
Provide training cell with sample code, loop, and evaluation metrics.

Update this notebook with actual ArcFace implementation details and dataset-handling for your specific setup.
